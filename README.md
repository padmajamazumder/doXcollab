**doXcollab** is a collaborative real-time document editing platform that enables users to work together on the same document, viewing and editing content simultaneously. This platform replicates the functionality of popular document collaboration tools like Google Docs, allowing users to share, edit, and manage documents efficiently in a synchronized environment.

The project is built using a modern tech stack, featuring **React** for the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend, and **MongoDB** for document storage. The platform is designed to ensure seamless real-time collaboration, data synchronization, and ease of use.

## Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously.
- **Document Management**: Create, edit, and manage documents securely.
- **Interactive Editor**: A rich text editor that allows users to modify documents in real-time.
- **Scalability**: Built with a scalable architecture using Node.js and MongoDB for handling multiple users.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, JavaScript, JSX, CSS
  - **Why React?**: React offers a dynamic, component-based architecture that is ideal for creating interactive, real-time web applications. Its virtual DOM allows for efficient updates and fast rendering.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
  - **Why Node.js?**: Node.js provides a lightweight, non-blocking, event-driven architecture that is perfect for real-time applications like collaborative document editing. Express.js is used to manage the server-side routing.
- **Database**: MongoDB
  - **Why MongoDB?**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is well-suited for storing unstructured document data. Its flexibility makes it ideal for managing different types of document formats.
- **Version Control**: Git
  - **Why Git?**: Git is used for tracking changes and managing the project version control.

```

### Client Side (`client/`)

- **App.js**: The root component of the React application. It initializes the app and routes to the editor.
- **Editor.jsx**: This component houses the collaborative text editor interface where users can edit and update documents in real-time. It connects to the backend via API calls.
- **index.js**: Entry point of the React app that renders the app in the browser.
- **CSS Files**: Styling of the app components.

### Server Side (`server/`)

- **index.js**: The main entry point of the Node.js server. This file handles setting up the Express server and routing requests to the appropriate controllers.
- **document-controller.js**: Handles all document-related operations, including creating, editing, and fetching documents from the MongoDB database.
- **db.js**: Configures and establishes the connection to the MongoDB database.
- **documentSchema.js**: Defines the structure of the documents stored in MongoDB, including fields like document content and user data.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

To run the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>=14.x)
- **MongoDB** (Ensure MongoDB is running locally or configure a cloud instance)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for managing dependencies)

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/doXcollab.git
   cd doXcollab
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for both client and server**:
   ```bash
   # In the root directory, install server dependencies
   cd server
   npm install

   # Install client dependencies
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure MongoDB**:
   Make sure your MongoDB server is running locally or on a cloud service. Update the connection string in `server/database/db.js` to match your MongoDB instance.

4. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

5. **Run the frontend**:
   In a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

6. **Access the application**:
   Once both the server and the frontend are running, open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Deployment

To deploy this application to services like Heroku, you need to set up environment variables for MongoDB and the port, and follow the deployment process for React and Node apps.

## Approach

The approach to building **doXcollab** is based on the principle of maintaining synchronization between the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) in real-time. 

### Steps:

1. **Frontend Design**:
   - **React Components**: Modular React components are used to create an interactive interface.
   - **Real-time Editor**: The `Editor.jsx` component is where users can edit documents collaboratively. It sends and receives updates from the server to ensure all users view the same content in real-time.

2. **Backend Logic**:
   - **Node.js and Express**: The server listens for incoming requests from the client. It handles creating, saving, and retrieving documents.
   - **MongoDB**: MongoDB is used to store the content of documents. The schema is flexible, allowing storage of various document formats.
   
3. **Synchronization**:
   - The frontend continuously communicates with the backend, ensuring that any changes made by a user are reflected across all connected users in real-time.

## Why This Stack?

- **React.js**: Provides a component-based architecture and a fast rendering experience, ideal for real-time interactions.
- **Node.js + Express**: Lightweight and well-suited for handling multiple requests in a collaborative platform.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that allows flexible document storage, perfect for managing user-generated content like collaborative documents.

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Implement a user authentication system for secure document sharing.
- **Version Control**: Add version history so that users can track changes and revert to previous versions.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Incorporate additional collaboration tools like comments, suggestions, and user roles.
